# High-Signal Rubric

Use this rubric while drafting entries.

## Keep
- A corrected workflow step that prevents repeat failure.
- A concrete user constraint that repeatedly changes acceptance criteria.
- A decision pattern that clearly improved speed/quality.
- A specific mistake pattern with a clear prevention rule.

## Reject
- Generic points ("test more", "communicate clearly").
- Personal tone/style observations unrelated to acceptance.
- Redundant variants of the same insight.
- Speculation without direct chat evidence.

## Scoring
Score each candidate from 0-2:
- Impact: effect on future outcome quality/speed.
- Reusability: likely to generalize beyond this exact task.
- Confidence: strength of explicit evidence in conversation.

Keep only total >= 5.
