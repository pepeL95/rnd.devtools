# High-Signal Rubric

Use this rubric while drafting entries.

## Keep
- A corrected workflow step that prevents repeat failure.
- A concrete user constraint that repeatedly changes acceptance criteria.
- A decision pattern that clearly improved speed/quality.
- A specific mistake pattern with a clear prevention rule.
- A reusable approach that can be applied to similar future tasks.

## Reject
- Generic points ("test more", "communicate clearly").
- Personal tone/style observations unrelated to acceptance.
- Redundant variants of the same insight.
- Speculation without direct chat evidence.
- One-off observations without clear transfer value.

## Scoring
Score each candidate from 0-2:
- Impact: effect on future outcome quality/speed.
- Reusability: likely to generalize beyond this exact task.
- Confidence: strength of explicit evidence in conversation.

Keep only total >= 5.
Break ties by selecting the most reusable correction/recovery pattern.

## Entry-Level RL Signal Score (0-10)
Assign once per entry:
- Impact (0-2): expected future quality/time improvement.
- Reusability (0-2): transferability across similar tasks.
- Evidence strength (0-2): direct, explicit support in conversation.
- Durability (0-2): likely to remain useful over time.
- Bonus (0-2): exceptional leverage with clear proof.

Guidance:
- 0-4: weak/noisy, usually do not keep.
- 5-6: moderate signal.
- 7-8: strong candidate signal.
- 9-10: rare, exceptional training value.
